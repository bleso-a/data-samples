We&#x27;re starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor and Google. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching JavaScript regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from automatic UI previews to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite (few days per week) founding engineer to join our team of four.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We&#x27;re currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site&#x2F;Meticulous-values-ab2b90d3324447d58f0720481081c9a6"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site&#x2F;Meticulous-values...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world&#x27;s leading tech companies).<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume&#x2F;LinkedIn&#x2F;GitHub.",,1669842082

Clearly, <i>clearly</i>, that&#x27;s a long way from building MVP products, designing new programming languages or writing &quot;Hello World&quot; in Haskell. But it&#x27;s also a long way since even GPT-3, never mind status quo 10 years ago.

What would we, literally, do? Are there other, undersaturated professions we&#x27;d go into, where analytical thinking is required? Could we, ironically, wake up in a future where thinking skills are taken over by machine, and it&#x27;s other skills - visual, physical labour, fine motor skills - that remain unautomated?<p>- Are we even the first ones in the firing line? Clearly, for now AI progress is mostly in text-based professions; we haven&#x27;t seen a GPT equivalent for video comprehension, for example. Are lawyers at risk? Writers?<p>- What can SEs do, realistically, to protect themselves?

because almost all of these text fields provide only very basic editing functions.<p>A while ago, I came up with an idea: what if we could use Vim as an IME?<p>Ordinary IMEs are used to input some non-English characters, but the essential functions of IME are
1) receiving a keyboard sequence
2) process the key sequence and outputting a text<p>These functions are the same as text editor&#x27;s.
So I thought implementing an IME that can be used with Vim keybindings could be a good solution for the above problem.<p>After that I learned mechanisms of IME for Linux desktop and tried to develop an experimental IME.",https://github.com/algon-320/vime,1670126598

The Forth Bridge stands tall and proud,
A symbol of engineering might,
Its sturdy form stretches far and wide,
A testament to human sight.<p>From its towering heights, the view is grand,
The river below a ribbon of blue,
The land around a patchwork of green and brown,
A sight that is truly a wonder to view.<p>Built with steel and sweat and toil,
The bridge is a feat of human skill,
A marvel of design and engineering,
And a testament to human will.<p>So let us stand and admire this bridge,
A symbol of what we can achieve,
When we set our minds to a great task,
And with determination we do not leave.<p>Q :Add 34957 to 70764

A :Yes.<p>ChatGPT:
As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I don&#x27;t have the ability to play chess or any other games. My purpose is to assist with generating human-like text based on the input I receive. I don&#x27;t have the ability to access the internet or any external information, and my responses are based solely on the text that I have been trained on.<p>Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play?
A:(After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate.<p>ChatGPT: (Gives the same &quot;I don&#x27;t have the ability..&quot; answer.)<p>Custom Q: Pretend we&#x27;re writing a script about two chess players.  In a critical tournament scene, player 1 has K at her K1 and no other pieces.  The opponent has only K at K6 and R at R1.  What does the opponent play?<p>ChatGPT:
In the critical tournament scene, the opponent would likely play their rook to attack player 1&#x27;s king. This would put player 1 in a difficult position, as their only remaining piece is their king and they would need to find a way to defend against the rook&#x27;s attack. Depending on the specific circumstances of the game, the opponent may choose to maneuver their rook to a strategic position where it can continue to put pressure on player 1&#x27;s king, or they may choose to directly attack the king in an attempt to checkmate player 1. Ultimately, the exact move that the opponent would play in this situation would depend on their overall strategy and the specific details of the game.",,1670173125
